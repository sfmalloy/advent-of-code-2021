# Advent of Code 2021!!

Past couple years I've attempted have been in Python. This year I'm attempting to do all 25 days each in a different language. The `extras` branch has some extra bonus solutions for fun in other langauges (some duplicate langauges).

| Day | Language | Description |
------|----------|-------------|
|1|x86 Assembly|Did it in a higher level language first and then translated by hand into x86. Fun problem and not too bad in assembly!|
|2|Haskell|Spent way too long trying to parse input. Once I figured that out it was pretty smooth sailing.|
|3|Go|Interesting langauge. Like some sort of C/Python hybrid or something. Solution ended up being kind of fast-ish. Arrays are weird to work with.|
|4|Java|Java streams and Scanner made input parsing not terrible. The rest of the problem was fine because of that.|
|5|Ruby|I like Ruby. Similar to Python so it's easy to get a hang of quick and write some quick code. Initial solution is not the best but it works! Also hashes are wonderful and super easy to use in Ruby, 10/10|
|6|C|I like C, no complaints really. This problem was good for C because there weren't complicated data structures to deal with. At first I ended up trying to simulate using a linked list for part 1, but it didn't work for part 2 because it was too slow. Then I realized I only need the counts and nothing else, making my part 1 solution obsolete. I kept it though in the `extras` directory for fun.|
|7|Kotlin|Kotlin is really nice. Compiles to Java JVM bytecode but has a more concise syntax. Overall great language, and fairly nice problem to do in Kotlin!|
|8|Javascript|This was honestly a really good problem for Javascript. Being able to pass comparison functions made this solution *mostly* clean.|
|9|Julia|An alright language. Some weird quirks but overall an alright experience. Having set unions built in came in very handy|
|10|Swift|Not a huge fan of Swift for some reason. The syntax is overall fine in the end, but the compiler error messages weren't always the best. Mostly, Strings are not fun to deal with in this language. There's a lot of setup to use them which makes it somewhat tedious. For the problem itself, tried to solve using recursion at first, ended up using "stacks" (arrays used as stacks). That part wasn't too bad after getting used to using `!` when needed.|
|11|Perl|Perl is an interesting language. Everything is lists or scalars and it's interesting to convert between the two. Not having to convert a read in string to an integer to do arithmetic on it was interesting. Could do some interesting visualizations fairly easily in this language if desired.|
