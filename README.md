# Advent of Code 2021!!

Past couple years I've attempted have been in Python. This year I'm attempting to do all 25 days each in a different language. I may have multiple solutions to some problems if I feel like experimenting in different langauges. To run them you need to `cd extras` and then compile/run.

| Day | Language | Description |
------|----------|-------------|
|1|x86 Assembly|Did it in a higher level language first and then translated by hand into x86. Fun problem and not too bad in assembly!|
