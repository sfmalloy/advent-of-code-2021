# Advent of Code 2021!!

Past couple years I've attempted have been in Python. This year I'm attempting to do all 25 days each in a different language. I may have multiple solutions to some problems if I feel like experimenting in different langauges. To run them you need to `cd extras` and then compile/run.

| Day | Language | Description |
------|----------|-------------|
|1|x86 Assembly|Did it in a higher level language first and then translated by hand into x86. Fun problem and not too bad in assembly!|
|2|Haskell|Spent way too long trying to parse input. Once I figured that out it was pretty smooth sailing.|
|3|Go|Interesting langauge. Like some sort of C/Python hybrid or something. Solution ended up being kind of fast-ish. Arrays are weird to work with.|
|4|Java|Java streams and Scanner made input parsing not terrible. The rest of the problem was fine because of that.|
|5|Ruby|I like Ruby. Similar to Python so it's easy to get a hang of quick and write some quick code. Initial solution is not the best but it works! Also hashes are wonderful and super easy to use in Ruby, 10/10|
|6|C|I like C, no complaints really. Possibly will try to super-optimize this. At first I ended up trying to simulate using a linked list for part 1, but it didn't work for part 2 because it was too slow. Then I realized I only need the counts and nothing else, making my part 1 solution obsolete. I kept it though in the `extras` directory for fun.|
